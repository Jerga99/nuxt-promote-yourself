1. Create "register" action
2. expect to receive register form data to an action
3. send a POST request to "/api/v1/users/register" with register form data
4. You don't need to handle "then" block in action just handle "catch" where
you will return Promise.reject with error
5. in register page create function "register" and dispatch register action with
register form data
6. In case of success redirect user to login page
7. in case of error display toast message with an error
8. on register button click call function register
9. Test your functionality, register an user and login after
NOTE: provide all data during registration, also an valid avatar url because
you can get an error in navbar since avatar would be undefined
GOOD LUCK (:
